# Trinity Cancer Transcriptome Analysis Toolkit (CTAT)

The Trinity Cancer Transcriptome Analysis Toolkit (CTAT) aims to provide tools for leveraging RNA-Seq to gain insights into the biology of cancer transcriptomes. Bioinformatics tool support is provided for mutation detection, fusion transcript identification, de novo transcript assembly of cancer-specific transcripts, lincRNA classification, and foreign transcript detection (viruses, microbes). CTAT is funded by the National Cancer Institute Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (NCI ITCR) program. 

For a description of the modules in Trinity CTAT, please visit our [Trinity CTAT Wiki](https://github.com/NCIP/Trinity_CTAT/wiki).

Each Trinity CTAT module is organized above as a submodule, which you can click through to easily access the relevant code and documentation.
